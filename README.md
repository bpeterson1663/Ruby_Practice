# Ruby Practice

After graduating from Prime Digital Academy, I wanted to continue learning something new. So I started to learn Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework.

This repository was created to keep the files I used to practice with. This repository is more for pracitce code and may not work if downloaded or cloned.
